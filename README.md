<h1>JobHuntr</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
JobHuntr is an iOS app designed to streamline the job hunting process, built primarily using SwiftUI.
It was created during my fourth year of university while applying to graduate software engineer roles.
The motivation behind JobHuntr was to simplify the job search experience, in keeping track of the progress of many job applications.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SwiftUI:</strong> JobHuntr's user interface was built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>AWS:</strong> JobHuntr leverages various AWS services for backend functionality and analytics.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Amplify:</strong> AWS Amplify was used for web/mobile API development, providing a scalable and secure backend for the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Pinpoint:</strong> AWS Pinpoint was utilized for retaining analytics, enabling the collection and analysis of user engagement data.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AWS Services:</strong> In building this app, I investigated the various services that AWS offer. I initially believed that I would be using an EC2 and S3 bucket to build a custom API solution. However,
  I found that AWS have an already pre-packaged method for interacting with iOS apps and other similar projects. Through this, I used Amplify for the backend API, and Pinpoint for recording app analytics.</li>
  <li><strong>iOS Development:</strong> Developing JobHuntr enhanced skills in iOS app development, especially with SwiftUI.</li>
  <li><strong>User Engagement:</strong> Whilst JobHuntr didn't gain traction, I learned valuable skills in market research and how to investigate building interest in a cost-effective manner.</li>
</ul>
